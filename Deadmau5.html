<h1><center>NAME ORIGIN</H1>
<H2><CENTER>Zimmerman's father claims that when his son was in his early teens, he was chatting with a friend on his computer, which then abruptly shut off. According to Zimmerman's father, he said that it had a smell like burnt wire and had a strange odor. Zimmerman started to dismantle his computer and happened to find a dead mouse. Zimmerman then became known as the "dead mouse guy" among friends. Joel tried to change his name to "Deadmouse" in an online chat room, but it was too long, so he shortened it to "deadmau5". 'Mausis the German word for a mouse and is pronounced the same as in English, the ending 5 instead of an 's' is a form of leet.Zimmerman created the original logo—called "mau5head"—while learning how to use some 3D modelling software.The logo appears in many different colors and designs, and has been shown on the cover of most of Zimmerman's albums, with the exceptions of At Play and Vexillology, (although both albums have since been re-released with the mau5head logo). He was given the idea to wear a headdress based on the logo by one of his friends, Jay Gordon of the industrial metal band Orgy. In an interview with CBC Television, Zimmerman said that he wants his logo to be an "icon". Fans often attend deadmau5 concerts sporting their own copy of the mau5head.
<br>
He created "deadmau5.com" and began uploading songs to SectionZ and producing under the alias "deadmau5" in 2002.
