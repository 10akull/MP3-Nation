<h1><CENTER>LYRICS</h1>
<pre><h2><center>I was the knight in shining armour in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time...

[4x:]
Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low

I was the prototype like 3 stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

I, I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time...

[4x:]
Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low

I, I, I, I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie, lie, lie, lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time...

Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low

Lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time...

Hey!

[4x:]
Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, low-low-low, low, low, low, low

<h1><center>BACKGROUND</h1>
<H2><center>In an interview with Idolator's Mike Wass, Bellion said "[All Time Low] is an illustration of what it feels like to be three days into a break up — the really heavy, emotional, 'I don’t even know if I want to continue living at this point.' I'm just being majorly honest and letting you know how horrible everything's been since you left. I don't think it's a specific situation but I want it to be broad so everyone can relate to that. I think everybody's been in that situation at least once in their life. Your first love… when that ends that's a devastating thing to feel."

<h1><center>MUSIC VIDEO</h1>
