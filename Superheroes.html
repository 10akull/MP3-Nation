<h1><center>LYRICS</h1>
<h2><center>
All her life she has seen<br>
All the meanest side of me<br>
They took away the prophet's dream for a profit on the street<br><br>

Now she's stronger than you know<br>
A heart of steel starts to grow<br>
<br>
All his life he's been told<br>
He'll be nothing when he's old<br>
All the kicks and all the blows<br>
He won't ever let it show<br>
<br>
'Cause he's stronger than you know<br>
A heart of steel starts to grow<br>
<br>
When you've been fighting for it all your life<br>
You've been struggling to make things right<br>
That's how a superhero learns to fly<br>
(Every day, every hour<br>
Turn the pain into power)<br>
<br>
When you've been fighting for it all your life<br>
You've been working every day and night<br>
That's how a superhero learns to fly<br>
(Every day, every hour<br>
Turn the pain into power)<br>
<br>
All the hurt, all the lies<br>
All the tears that they cry<br>
When the moment is just right<br>
You see fire in their eyes<br>
<br>
'Cause he's stronger than you know<br>
A heart of steel starts to grow<br>
<br>
When you've been fighting for it all your life<br>
You've been struggling to make things right<br>
That's how a superhero learns to fly<br>
Every day, every hour<br>
Turn the pain into power<br>
<br>
When you've been fighting for it all your life<br>
You've been working every day and night<br>
That's how a superhero learns to fly<br>
<br>
(Every day, every hour<br>
Turn the pain into power)<br>
<br>
(Power, power, power, power, power)<br>
(Power, power, power, power, power)<br>
<br>
(Every day, every hour<br>
Turn the pain into power)<br>
<br>
(Power, power, power, power, power)<br>
(Power, power, power, power, power)<br>
<br>
(Every day, every hour<br>
Turn the pain into power)<br>
<br>
She's got lions in her heart<br>
A fire in her soul<br>
He's got a beast in his belly<br>
That's so hard to control<br>
'Cause they've taken too much hits<br>
Taking blow by blow<br>
Now light a match, stand back, watch them explode<br>
<br>
