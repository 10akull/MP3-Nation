<H2><CENTER>
I got my red dress on tonight<BR>
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight<BR>
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style<BR>
High heels off, I'm feeling alive<BR>
<BR><BR>
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air<BR>
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare<BR>
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere<BR>
Nothing scares me anymore<BR>
<BR><BR>
Kiss me hard before you go<BR>
Summertime sadness<BR>
I just wanted you to know<BR>
That, baby, you're the best<BR>
<BR><BR>
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
Got that summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
Oh, oh, oh<BR>
<BR><BR>
I've got that summertime<BR>
I've got that summertime<BR>
I've got that summertime<BR>
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
<BR><BR>
I've got that summertime<BR>
I've got that summertime<BR>
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
<BR><BR>
I'm feelin' electric tonight<BR>
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99<BR>
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side<BR>
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight<BR>
<BR><BR>
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air<BR>
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare<BR>
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere<BR>
Nothing scares me anymore<BR>
<BR><BR>
Kiss me hard before you go<BR>
Summertime sadness<BR>
I just wanted you to know<BR>
That, baby, you're the best<BR>
<BR><BR>
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
Got that summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
Oh, oh, oh<BR>

I've got that summertime<BR>
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
Got that summertime, summertime sadness<BR>
Oh, oh, oh<BR>

<h1><center>ABOUT</h1>
<font color = "grey">
<H2><center>In January 2013, a remix by Cedric Gervais was commissioned for the record label Universal Germany. However, the remix was initially turned down by Interscope and Polydor Records, Lana Del Rey's record labels in America and the UK, respectively, but was released on Spinnin' Records. In the spring of 2013, the remix quickly surged to number one on Beatport, resulting in several radio programmers and DJs, such as Pete Tong, working the song into their radio station's rotation. BBC Radio 1 added the remix to its playlist, helping it to gain popularity around the world. Several Sirius XM radio stations began playing it, and Interscope decided to push at Top 40 radio in the United States. After positive feedback, Interscope agreed to release the remix.

<h1><center>BACKGROUND</h1>
<font color = "grey">
<h2><center>Hesitant to accept requests for remixes from other artists, Gervais immediately consented to assisting Del Rey with remixing "Summertime Sadness". "To me," he said, "it is not about the money, so I turned down a lot of people. But Lana Del Rey came in. I didn't even ask how much money I just said please send me the vocals right away and I did the track in one day. I wasn't thinking if it was going to be a hit or not, I just love and respect the artist that she is." Satisfied with the finished product, Del Rey's team commissioned Gervais to produce a mix version of "Young and Beautiful".
<br>
The decision to release the new version of "Summertime Sadness" on the DJ's primary label, Spinnin' Records, was made by Cedric's manager Luke Allen (Red Light Management) to expand the song's audience to Gervais' EDM fanbase. Allen grew and built the record from grass roots, but it wasn't until he invited Interscope A&R John Ehmann to a performance at the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas that the major label came on board, after Ehmann heard 60,000 people singing along to the song. Months later, the house track was a sleeper hit, peaking at number 6 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. "In every country I'm going to, I hear my remix on the radio," the DJ commented on the song's success. "I heard it on the MTV Awards while they're introducing Selena Gomez. It motivates me. I started a long time ago in the business with the passion of being a DJ and all of the sudden I make a track like this I get even more excited and motivated. It opens the door to so many things." Becoming the most successful work of his career at the time, "Summertime Sadness" unlocked a plethora of opportunities for Gervais, including a contract for the release of a full-length album that features many high-profile dance singers, Rick Nowels (co-writer of "Summertime Sadness"'s lyrics) assisting him. </h2>

<h1><center>MUSIC VIDEO</h1>
<font color = "grey">
<h2><center>Gervais' interpretation of "Summertime Sadness" received a video treatment. The majority of the video includes the same footage of the original version produced by Kyle Newman.Sam Lansky of Idolator described the remake as being "...stitched together with familiar glitchy footage of Lana in her conventional Tumblrwave style."Expanding, he said: "the euphoric house production contrasts with the melancholy aesthetic in that way that feels quintessentially Lana and, well, if nothing else, the track is straight fire."Further, Lansky remarked on the audio, stating: "The gloomy cut has received a proper single treatment" from Cedric Gervais who metamorphosed "Lana"s lachrymose original into a dancefloor stomper".</h2>
