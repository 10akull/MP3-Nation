<h1><center>LYRICS</h1>
<h2><center>Baby, I'm preying on you tonight<br>
Hunt you down eat you alive<br>
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals<br>
<br>
Maybe you think that you can hide<br>
I can smell your scent from miles<br>
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals<br>
Baby, I'm<br>
<br>
So what you trying to do to me<br>
It's like we can't stop we're enemies<br>
But we get along when I'm inside you<br>
You're like a drug that's killing me<br>
I cut you out entirely<br>
But I get so high when I'm inside you<br>
<br>
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free<br>
You can find other fish in the sea<br>
You can pretend it's meant to be<br>
But you can't stay away from me<br>
I can still hear you making that sound<br>
Taking me down, rolling on the ground<br>
You can pretend that it was me<br>
But no<br>
<br>
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight<br>
Hunt you down eat you alive<br>
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals<br>

I can smell your scent from miles<br>
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals<br>
Baby, I'm<br>
<br>
So if I run it's not enough<br>
You're still in my head forever stuck<br>
So you can do what you wanna do<br>
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up<br>
But don't deny the animal<br>
That comes alive when I'm inside you<br>
<br>
Yeah, you can start over you can run free<br>
You can find other fish in the sea<br>
You can pretend it's meant to be<br>
But you can't stay away from me<br>
I can still hear you making that sound<br>
Taking me down rolling on the ground<br>
You can pretend that it was me<br>
But no<br>
<br>

<br>
The lyric video for the song was released on August 22, 2014 on Vevo. A snippet of "Animals" was featured in a Kia Soul commercial, published on August 21, 2014.

<h1><center>CRITICAL RECEPTION</h1>
<h2><center>Rolling Stone ranked "Animals" at number 32 on its year-end list of the 50 best songs of 2014.</h2>
<hr>
<h1><center>MUSIC VIDEO</h1>
<h2><center>The music video, directed by Samuel Bayer (who previously worked with the band on the clip for their 2012 single "Payphone") was released on September 29, 2014. It mainly features Adam Levine and his wife, Behati Prinsloo. The other musicians of Maroon 5 (including their touring member, Sam Farrar, who appeared in a music video of the band for the very first time) also make an appearance - they are seen playing at a nightclub in some scenes of the video.
<br>
The video starts with a woman (played by Prinsloo) entering a slaughterhouse, where Levine's character works. After she leaves, an infatuated Levine begins to stalk the woman by following her in the streets and standing outside her apartment in the pouring rain to watch her. He also watches the woman in her sleep and takes numerous photos of Prinsloo which he later trims and places on wires around a dark room. Intercut with this are scenes of a shirtless Levine dripping in fake blood, singing the song inside a meat locker and using animal carcasses for punching bags (referencing to Rocky). One evening, Levine follows the woman into a nightclub, where he tries to talk to her. Though Prinsloo is amused by Levine and his interest in her, she spends the evening talking to her girlfriends instead. Eventually, Levine is left with no luck, so he goes back to fantasizing about the girl. After an erotic dream, Levine wakes up in a shock and returns to stalking Prinsloo by standing outside her apartment in the rain watching in a dazed state, leading to the similar opening. The final scenes feature Levine and Prinsloo as obsessed lovers kissing—whilst disrobed and covered in fake blood.
<br>
The music video was heavily panned by critics[citation needed] and has been condemned[by whom?] for dehumanizing women and glamorizing violence. Jessica Valenti of The Guardian criticized the video for attempting to make violence against women seem "edgy" stating that "there is nothing 'alternative' about showing women being stalked, hunted, raped or killed because it’s something that happens every damn day." RAINN (Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network) released a statement condemning the video, which wrote that "No one should ever confuse the criminal act of stalking with romance. The trivialisation of these serious crimes, like stalking, should have no place in the entertainment industry."</h2>
